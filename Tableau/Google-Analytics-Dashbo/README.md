 1. Problem Statement
The objective of this project was to analyze website performance and user acquisition patterns using a
Google Analytics (GA4) dataset. Business stakeholders needed to understand which regions were driving the highest revenue and how user
engagement varied across different states to optimize marketing resource allocation." 


3. Tools & Technical Process
(i)   Data Wrangling: Conducted end-to-end data cleaning and preparation using Google Sheets, ensuring data integrity for dimensions like 'Region' and 'Revenue'. 
(ii)  Visualization: Developed a multi-dimensional dashboard in Tableau utilizing geographic maps, treemaps, and heat matrices to visualize complex consumer behavior.
(iii) Calculated Fields: Implemented custom logic to segment users and calculate market share percentages (e.g., identifying that California accounts for 54.05% of total users).

3. Key Insights & Business Recommendations
(i)   Regional Dominance: California is the primary revenue driver, contributing the highest volume of transactions (9,230) and revenue distribution.
(ii)  Market Share Concentration: Three states (California, Texas, and New York) represent over 83% of the analyzed user acquisition, suggesting a highly concentrated market.
(iii) Strategic Recommendation: Marketing efforts should be intensified in high-engagement regions like California to maximize ROI, while "State Level Engagement" metrics should be used to investigate why smaller markets have lower pages-per-session.
