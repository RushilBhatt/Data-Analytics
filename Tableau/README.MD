** Google Analytics Website Performance Dashboard **
1. Problem Statement
* The objective of this project was to analyze website performance and user acquisition patterns using a Google Analytics (GA4) dataset. Business stakeholders needed to understand which v    regions were driving the highest revenue and how user engagement varied across different states to optimize marketing resource allocation.

2. Tools & Technical Process
* Data Wrangling Conducted end-to-end data cleaning and preparation using Google Sheets, ensuring data integrity for dimensions like 'Region' and 'Revenue'.
* Visualization Developed a multi-dimensional dashboard in Tableau utilizing geographic maps, treemaps, and heat matrices to visualize complex consumer behavior.
* Calculated Fields Implemented custom logic to segment users and calculate market share percentages, specifically identifying that California accounts for 54.05% of total users.

3. Key Insights & Business Recommendations
* Regional Dominance California is the primary revenue driver, contributing the highest volume of transactions (9,230) and revenue distribution.
* Market Share Concentration Three states (California, Texas, and New York) represent over 83% of the analyzed user acquisition, suggesting a highly concentrated market.
* Strategic Recommendation Marketing efforts should be intensified in high-engagement regions like California to maximize ROI, while "State Level Engagement" metrics should be used to investigate why smaller markets have lower pages-per-session.
